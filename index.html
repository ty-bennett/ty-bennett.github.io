        Hello, my name is Ty Bennett! I am a sophomore computer science major at the University of South Carolina.
        My personal mission is to make tech more accessible by combining my passion for people and technology. I am an aspiring DevOps Engineer with
        a background in networking and cloud infrastructure. I hold an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate <strong>(SAA-C03)</strong>,
        and currently work as a Networking Intern for the Department of Administration for the State of SC. I am heavily involved on campus
        and I love leadership. Currently, I am an undergraduate teaching assistant for CSCE 190, and am President for the Association for Computing Machinery chapter
        at USC.
        <<!-- Hi! My name is Ty and I am a freshman Computer Science major at the University of South Carolina.
         I am an aspiring software engineer looking for more opportunities and internships in development, 
         cloud app development, cloud computing, and backend engineering roles. 
         My personal mission is to get people interested in technology and

      <a href="files/problemstatement.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/problemstatement.png" class="project-img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></a>
      <p><strong>There is currently no central lost and found system, making it difficult for students to report, track, and recover lost items.</strong></p> 
      <p>There is always a number of students losing items on campus. If we had a central way to report lost items on campus, where they were found, as well as a way to recover those items, students would
        stop flooding the community Snapchat story with lost Carolina Cards, sets of keys, wallets, or even credit cards.</p>

    <!-- Affinity Diagram Assignment -->

      <a href="files/affinitydiagram.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/affinitydiagram.png"></a>
      <p>Affinity Diagram's are a way to collect ideas about a certian topic and group those ideas based on categories.
        My group and I came up with some ideas about an app that we would make regarding a lost and found system for USC's campus due to
        there currently being no central way to report, track, and retrieve lost items on campus. Some of these idea categories included
        how we would advertise our app, what tech stack we would use, how we would collect and apply user's reviews, some basic features
        that our app would have, and plenty of other ideas.

   <!--Sketches Assignment-->
    <section class="project">
      <a href="files/sketches.pdf" target="_blank"><h3 class="project-title">Wireframe Sketches</h3></a>
      <a href="files/sketches.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/sketches.png"></a>
      <p>
      Wireframe sketches are a great way to develop a prototypical view of an app that you are designing. My group and 
      I decided to create three different scenarios for three different kinds of users using our app. One scenario is 
      a user who lost an item and is on the forum trying to recover it, the second scenario is a user who found a 
      lost item and is wanting to report it on the forum, and the third scenario is a data scientist who wants to 
      collect different metrics about the most common places items are lost, what kinds of items are lost the most,
      and how many items have been recovered, lost, or are in the process of recovery now. The data scientist can export
      all of this data into a usable format, e.g. a .csv file for data processing and metrics in case they would want
      to visualize this data for presentation.

  <!-- Paper Prototype Assingment -->
    <section class="project">
      <a href="https://youtu.be/KbU6A6ha7Nk" target="_blank"><h3 class="project-title">Paper Prototype</h3></a>
     <a href="https://youtu.be/KbU6A6ha7Nk" target="_blank"><img src="images/prototype.jpg"></a>
      <p>A paper prototype is a good way to see the functionality of your app before you actually design it. For my app design, my group 
      wanted to design an app that allowed for a central system to post, recover, and track lost items. My video covers all functionality
      discussed in my wireframe sketches and I tried to model my user interface after apps that I was familiar with already.

        my CSCE 145 class where we learn the fundamentals of Java and some basic data structures and algorithms. Click the link to keep up!
